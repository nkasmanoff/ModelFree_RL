# ModelFree_RL


My  attempts at a few different reinforcement learning strategies. 


Mainly, the two notebooks linked are for value and policy based learning, where I train a PyTorch Neural Network to play some of the basic control games in OpenAI's gym. I would try to play more, but I can't load them in :-) Even if I did, it would certainly take a lot longer to train and I think these environments get the point across. 


Some of the resources I'd like to thank for getting me this far are:
